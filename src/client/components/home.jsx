      <p>Welcome to the ISKCON of Bay Area Temple in Berkeley! When Param Pujya A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami
      Shrila Prabhupada (Shrila Prabhupada), then 71, travelled by air for the very first time in his life, he
      landed in our Bay Area&#39;s San Francisco International Airport. This maiden air journey by Shrila
      Prabhupad in January 1967 brought to the United States&#39; West Coast his newly started Hare Krishna
      movement. The very first temple, Radha Krishna Temple, was located at 518 Frederick Street in the
      Haight-Ashbury district of San Francisco. During the initiation of this Temple, a remarkable event
      unfolded: a female disciple of Swamiji brought a small three-inch wooden doll with a flat head, a black
      smiling face, and big round eyes that she had purchased from a local import store as a piece of Indian
      antique. This three-inch wooden doll with a flat head, a black smiling face, and big round eyes was none
      other than Shri Jagannath Dev, Shri Krishna Himself, who until then was only being worshipped in India
      in the historical city of Puri with His brother Baldev and sister Subhadra. Shrila Prabhupad took this as a
      divine signal to initiate in the western world the worship of Shri Jagannath, Baldev and Subhadra (hence
      this temple!). Along with this initiation came to the western world Puri&#39;s Rath Yatra: each year in Puri,
      during the yearly gigantic Ratha-yatra festival, millions of pilgrims pull the three huge carts carrying the
      deities of Jagannatha Swami, Baldev, and Subhadra. The Golden Avatar of this dark age, Shri Caitanya
      Dev, spent the last eighteen years of His life at Puri, dancing and chanting in ecstasy before the Deity of
      Lord Jagannatha during the Ratha-yatra festival. Shrila Prabhupad initiated the Ratha-yatra festival in
      San Francisco. Further, to memorialize this advent of Shri Jagannath dev and His Rath Yatra, he gave San
      Francisco a new and spiritual name: the New Jagannatha Puri. This temple in Berkeley was established
      by Shrila Prabhupad in his early seventies.</p>
      <p>With the upheavals that unfolded during the subsequent years after Shrila Prabhupad&#39;s departure from
      this mortal world in 1977 in Vrindavan, India, the temple sold many of its properties and the current
      building of 2334 Stuart Street is the last one remaining. Here, deities of Jagannatha Swami, Baldev, and
      Subhadra are in the center of the altar. To the right are the deities of Radha Gokulananda and to the left
      are Shri Caitanya Dev and Shri Nityaananda Dev. Regular puja on all 365 days of the year is conducted by
      fulltime and volunteer pujaris. On Sunday evenings, the atmosphere of a festival surrounds the Mandir
      with hours of Hare Krishna chanting, a spiritual discourse, and a feast of vegetarian/vegan Prasad (the
      food preparations sanctified by first offering them to Krishna) are distributed amidst the chanting of
      Hare Krishna mantra:</p>
      <b>Hare Krishna Hare Krishna</b><br/>
      <b>Krishna Krishna Hare Hare</b><br/>
      <b>Hare Rama Hare Rama</b><br/>
      <b>Rama Rama Hare Hare</b><br/><br/>
      <p>Come late summer, Puri&#39;s Rath Yatra festival is replicated in Bay Area with great pomp and show under
      the auspices of this temple. Thousands of devotes from California&#39;s San Francisco Bay Area form an
      ocean of joy pulling the three chariots of Shri Jagannatha Swami, Baldev, and Subhadra around San Francisco&#39;s
      Golden Gate park. A festival showcasing all that Vedic culture has to offer unfolds after the
      Ratha Yatra: dance, art, philosophy, and of course, vegan/vegetarian food!</p>
      <p>Please enjoy the divine atmosphere of this temple and partake in its numerous spiritual activities!</p>
      <p><i>Jai Jagannath! Jai Baldev, Jai Subhadra!</i><br/>
